OOOCode
=======

Libraries to add OO patterns to OpenTV applications

Working with the project in the OpenTV IDE
------------------------------------------

To work with this project you will need to use the OpenTV IDE which is based on Eclipse.

# Download and install the IDE from http://community.opentv.com
# I recommend creating a new workspace in the root of the project
# In the IDE choose *File/Import...*
# In the resulting dialog choose *General/Existing Projects Into Workspace* and press *Next*
# Choose the *Select Root Directory:* Radio button and *Browse...* to the root of the project
# The 4 sub projects should then be listed under *Projects*
# Click *Select All* and then click *Finish*
# You should then be able to build the projects by choosing *Project/Build All*

After you have built the projects at least once run the test application in the Virtual Set top box by:

# Choosing the *OOOCodeFlow* project on the left
# Pressing the green *Run* button at the top
# In the resulting dialog choose *Local OpenTV Application* and press *OK*
