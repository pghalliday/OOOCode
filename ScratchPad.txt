Accessing fields could do with a shortcut... F(name) perhaps?
Don't much like having 3 method calling conventions but i think i can live with it for now
Should do some performance checks as worried about:
- indirection in function calls
- indirection in field access
- indirection in destroy function
- extra memory used for destroy function entry in object instance
