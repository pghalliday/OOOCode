ToDo
----

OOOEmptyArguments.Test
OOOPastingAndQuoting.Test
OOOCode.Test - Write lots of tests for calling conventions and macro use focusing on:
- empty argument lists
- using macros in macro arguments
- maximum number of macro arguments

Automate OOOTests.h generation / Integrate advanced build scripts

Generate a Unit Test DLL and implement a server application in the VSTB to receive the DLL and run tests

Concerns
--------

I don't really need to use interfaces and classes for unit test definitions (could just use function pointers as I have in the past) but it has an elegance... It will also take longer to compile and run though!! Gah!

Cannot copy instances easily. Memcpy will result in interfaces pointing at incorrect instances and all fields will be lost. Do I care?

Don't much like having 3 method calling conventions but i think i can live with it for now

Should do some performance checks as worried about:
- indirection in function calls
- indirection in destroy function
- extra memory used for destroy function entry in object instance
